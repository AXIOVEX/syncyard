# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Fixed
- Tray GDI handle leak (field crash, 2026-11-01): the tray
  re-rendered its status icon on every 5 s supervision tick and
  leaked the rendered bitmap and the icon handle each time (the
  bitmap was never disposed, and `Icon.FromHandle` handles are not
  released by `Dispose`). After about 10.5 h (roughly 7,500 ticks,
  15,000 handles against the 10,000 per-process GDI quota) the tray
  died with a `System.Drawing` `OutOfMemoryException` raised while
  it was constructing its own error dialog. The icon now renders
  only on a state change, the bitmap is disposed, the borrowed
  HICON is cloned and destroyed, the replaced context menu is
  disposed, supervision ticks run under a catch-and-log guard, and
  UI-thread exceptions are caught and logged instead of surfacing
  the modal .NET dialog. A static source battery
  (`runner/tray/test_tray_source.py`, wired into CI) pins the
  patterns. Spec 007.

### Added
- Spec 011 Amendment 1 (2026-10-31): owner ruling on boot
  autonomy. The FR-009 owner gate is satisfied by directive —
  Syncyard must start automatically on boot with **no
  interactive logon**; autologon is excluded by the ruling's
  own words. Selected shape: service-mode runners running as
  the owner account (the boot-scheduled launcher is the named
  fallback if the one-lane proof fails on WSL reachability),
  per-lane `boot-runnable` / `logon-bound` honesty labels
  unchanged, the backchannel agent in the boot set (linger +
  distro-start ensure), and the tray's logon autostart
  retired in the conversion. New FR-015: `gk reboot` — a
  controlled, drain-aware host reboot (going-down record
  before any signal, backchannel route first, honest
  unreachable report otherwise). Implementation follows in
  Phase 5 as amended (T011–T014, T021, T022).
- Spec 011 T021 (2026-11-01): `gk reboot --host <host>
  [--force] [--delay <seconds>] [--requested-by <chat-id>]`
  (FR-015) implemented in the gatekeeper. Route determination
  is reads-only and first: a fresh backchannel heartbeat
  (<= 300 s) routes via the backchannel agent, else any
  online runner of the host routes via a maintenance
  dispatch, else the host is reported unreachable (exit 4)
  and nothing else is written. Active jobs on the host's
  lanes refuse the reboot by name (exit 3) unless --force.
  On acceptance the FR-003 going-down record (trigger
  `remote-reboot`) goes through the existing ingest —
  annotations, dispatch hold, and outbox pushes are the
  Phase 1 semantics — then a `host_reboot_requested` ledger
  event names the requesting chat, and only then is the
  host signaled with the grace delay (new config
  `reboot.grace_s`, default 60, validated positive, fail
  closed). The maintenance-route signal job is exempt from
  the going-down hold it rides under; every other job on
  the host stays held. The gatekeeper still never cancels
  and never re-dispatches. Golden scenario 7 pins the
  refusal, the record-before-signal order, both routes,
  and the unreachable path; the live fire drill is T022,
  still open.
- Spec 011 Phase 1 (T001–T003, gatekeeper side, 2026-10-31):
  host liveness and the going-down record. New config
  `liveness.down_after_s` (default 900, validated positive,
  fail closed). Each sweep reads the backchannel heartbeat
  once and keeps a per-host last-seen record (`hosts.json`,
  verified writes); `gk status` renders every host UP/DOWN
  with its heartbeat age. A going-down record arriving as
  the heartbeat's `going_down` field is ingested exactly
  once per (host, ts): a `host_going_down` ledger event,
  `interrupted_by: "host-shutdown"` annotations on the
  affected job records, one outbox push per affected notify
  registration, and a dispatch hold on the host's lanes
  until `gk host-resume <host>` clears it (the Phase-1
  stand-in for the FR-010 recovery handshake). The
  gatekeeper still never cancels and never re-dispatches.
  The protection level is unchanged and stated plainly in
  the spec: delay + drain + checkpoint + notify, never
  prevent.
- Spec 010 Phase 6 (T021, 2026-10-31): `docs/github-pitch.md`
  — the GitHub adoption pitch brief (gh-extension-first
  shape). Prepared only; not sent — the owner's explicit
  word is required before it leaves the repo.

### Fixed
- Backchannel agent body handling (issue #36, 2026-11-01):
  the agent extracted the command body through a bash command
  substitution, which strips trailing newlines — so it hashed
  and executed different bytes than the ones `bc.py` signed,
  and **every `send --file` of an ordinary file** (which ends
  in a newline) was sha-refused with exit 65 (field case: a
  2,767-byte script, claimed `1e7ba777…`, agent computed the
  hash of the same bytes minus the final newline). The agent
  now extracts the body byte-exactly to the command file with
  Python, hashes that file, and executes that file; the wire
  format, envelope schema, STOP and idempotence semantics are
  unchanged, and the mismatch refusal (exit 65) is preserved —
  it now fires only on genuine mismatches. The scalar
  `json_get` fields (id, sha256, timeout_s) were verified
  unaffected: their values never end in a newline.
- Backchannel execution bound (issue #36, 2026-11-01): the
  execution wrapper ran plain `timeout`, whose SIGTERM does
  not bound a body that traps or ignores it — measured on a
  TERM-ignoring `sleep 60` under `timeout_s=3`: the body ran
  its full 60 s, stalling the single-threaded agent (and its
  heartbeat) behind it. The wrapper now runs
  `timeout --kill-after=$SYNCBC_KILL_AFTER_S` (default 10 s):
  a stubborn body is SIGKILLed after its grace and recorded
  as 137 instead of running unbounded; cooperative timeouts
  still record 124, and a body's own status or signal death
  propagates unchanged — a wrapper-killed body is never
  recorded as 0. Same battery pass also pinned what was
  already honest: the stored `stdout_tail` is byte-for-byte
  the last `SYNCBC_TAIL_BYTES` (8000) of the full output — a
  tail window by design, not evidence a body died early. The
  field diagnostics that stopped mid-script around a
  `docker.exe` interop call (2026-11-01) could not be
  reproduced off the WSL host or pinned to a wrapper line;
  the record keeps the narrowing above and claims no more.
- `backchannel/test_chaos.py` gains four cases: a multi-line
  body ending in a newline executing with byte-exact fidelity
  (fails pre-fix with the field's exit 65), an oversized-output
  tail-semantics case, exit-code pins (own status 3, SIGKILL
  137, cooperative timeout 124, TERM-ignoring body bounded),
  and a genuine-mismatch refusal case proving the security
  property survived the fix.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-31
### Added
- Spec 010 Phase 5 docs (T017 + T018, 2026-10-31):
  `SECURITY.md` is now the shipped security posture — the
  FR-009 invariant verbatim (the same sentence every skill
  edition carries), the posture in plain language (CI on
  GitHub-hosted runners only; self-hosted runners reachable
  solely behind the gatekeeper's `workflow_dispatch`; the
  gatekeeper's verified-write and exactly-once dispatch
  rules; the backchannel as dev/recovery only, carrying no
  job traffic), and adopter checklists for token scoping and
  runner isolation — alongside the existing reporting policy.
  `README.md` opens with the two-minute story FR-010
  requires (the problem, the scars that shaped the design,
  what Syncyard deliberately does not do), the security
  section links `SECURITY.md` above the quickstart, and
  per-host quickstarts cover Windows, WSL2 (via a Windows
  host), Linux, macOS, and Docker — including the fleet rule
  that cross-job payloads are never staged in a WSL venue's
  `/tmp` (it does not persist between jobs; stage in the WSL
  home directory or the job's working tree instead).
- Spec 011 — shutdown protection and recovery (owner
  direction, 2026-10-31): a host-side shutdown guard that
  delays a non-forced shutdown while active work drains
  (bounded checkpoint window, going-down record written
  first with the affected run ids, outbox notification),
  boot recovery that returns runners without an interactive
  logon (boot shape is an owner gate — service-mode would
  amend spec 007 FR-003), a generalized supervised-work
  vehicle from the production anchor pattern, gatekeeper
  reconciliation of every interrupted run against GitHub's
  terminal state, and a recovery report that states loss
  plainly. The spec's protection level is delay + drain +
  checkpoint + notify, never prevent — forced shutdowns and
  power loss are named outside the envelope. Specified only
  in this change; implementation follows in phases.
- Spec 010 Phase 4 (FR-006) — the agent skills pack:
  `skills/` ships eight editions generated from one shared
  source (`skills/_source/contract.md` via
  `skills/build_skills.py`) in the Amendment 1 ranking —
  Meta Muse (primary), Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, OpenAI
  Codex/ChatGPT, Cursor, Google Gemini/Antigravity,
  generic-agent, and a CLI-only fallback. Each edition carries
  the FR-009 security invariant verbatim; the T016 currency
  battery (`skills/test_skills.py`, in CI) pins every edition
  to the repo VERSION, the invariant, and the shared source
  (drift fails the build).
- Spec 010 — public release program (owner direction,
  2026-10-30): configurability as a single config file (lane
  count/names, watermarks, budgets, endpoints, transport
  ceiling), a tested host matrix (Windows, WSL2, macOS, Linux,
  Docker), permanent backchannel hardening (self-test, stale
  alarm, chaos battery), an agent skills pack with Meta Muse
  as the primary vehicle, per-requirement test batteries, a
  shipped security posture, and release 0.3.0 when green. A
  GitHub `gh`-adoption pitch brief is prepared under FR-011
  and is not sent without the owner's explicit word. Specified
  only in this change; implementation follows in phases.
- Spec 010 Amendment 1 (2026-10-30): FR-012 ships Syncyard as
  a GitHub CLI extension (`AXIOVEX/gh-syncyard`, thin Go
  dispatcher, official precompile action); FR-006 agent-skill
  editions ranked by market share (Meta Muse primary, Claude
  Code, Copilot, Codex/ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini/Antigravity,
  generic). Phase 1 slice 1: `config/syncyard.example.yaml` +
  `gatekeeper/config.py` loader/validator with the
  `test_config.py` golden battery (25 checks, all passing);
  additive — the gatekeeper does not read config yet.
- Spec 010 Phase 7 (FR-012) SHIPPED 2026-10-31:
  `AXIOVEX/gh-syncyard` v0.1.0 — the GitHub CLI extension.
  Thin Go dispatcher over the installed gatekeeper
  (lookup: $SYNCYARD_GK / $SYNCYARD_HOME / ~/syncyard /
  ~/.syncyard / beside the binary / ./gatekeeper);
  precompiled binaries via the official precompile action;
  install proof: `gh extension install AXIOVEX/gh-syncyard`
  then `gh syncyard status` against the live fleet.
- Spec 010 Phase 1 slice 2 (T003/T004, 2026-10-31): the
  gatekeeper now reads its effective configuration at
  startup — lane set, runner labels, per-lane concurrency,
  watermark tables, budgets, and dispatch knobs all bind
  from `syncyard.yaml` deep-merged over the built-in
  defaults (the pre-config constants verbatim); invalid
  config fails closed with a named error.
  `gatekeeper/test_golden.py` proves byte-identical
  dispatch decisions under defaults vs the fleet config,
  and runs in CI.
- Spec 010 Phase 1 COMPLETE (T005, 2026-10-31): the fleet
  gatekeeper now runs on the configuration system — wired
  code deployed behind a queue snapshot (534 records,
  open-set 5) with exact reconciliation, and the fleet
  `syncyard.yaml` in place beside the gatekeeper.
- Spec 010 Phase 2 begins (T006, 2026-10-31): hosts declare
  the transport workflows they serve (execute/grab) and
  their identity markers (a per-type contract); the
  gatekeeper routes by host and refuses, at submit/adopt,
  any job addressed to a venue that does not serve its
  workflow — no silent fallback. Config validation covers
  the new shape; the golden battery pins the routing
  matrix across the fleet hosts plus a config-only macOS
  host.
- Spec 010 T007 (2026-10-31): the shipped transport
  workflows are generalized — a `lane` input addresses the
  runner, hardcoded label lists are gone, and each file
  states its host contract; execution bodies unchanged
  from the proven production shape. New contract battery
  in CI pins dispatch-only triggers and lane binding.
- Spec 010 Phase 2 COMPLETE (T008/T009, 2026-10-31):
  native Linux and macOS transports (one shared script
  body, drift-checked), a Docker transport (caller image,
  declared mounts, results land on the host for grab
  return), and gatekeeper `--image`/`--mounts` submit
  options with host-config image fallback — all pinned by
  golden argv checks and a hosted smoke battery
  (ubuntu + macOS + a docker-required job).
- Spec 010 Phase 3 COMPLETE (T010–T013, 2026-10-31): the
  backchannel agent self-tests at start-up and reports
  the result in every heartbeat; `gk status` shows the
  heartbeat age with a stale alarm past five minutes;
  a 16-check chaos battery (duplicates, corruption, STOP,
  kill/restart) runs the real agent in CI; and the
  recovery runbook ships the four FR-007 cases with
  pre-written command bodies.
- Spec 009 — failsafe backchannel (owner override order,
  2026-10-29: Syncyard must have a failsafe backchannel for when
  Syncyard itself is down or blocked, with a dedicated channel
  just for Syncyard development in the Desktop Access chat).
  A dedicated channel `syncyard-dev` in the private repo
  `tbitcs/syncyard-backchannel` (`channels/syncyard-dev/cmd.json`,
  `out.json`, `heartbeat.json`), reserved exclusively for
  Syncyard development/recovery by the Desktop Access chat — no
  program job traffic, ever, and no other chat may post to it.
  The desktop agent (`backchannel/agent.sh`) runs as a WSL
  systemd user service independent of the runners, the tray, and
  the gatekeeper, syncs over git (no REST quota), executes only
  new, hash-verified command ids, honours a STOP kill switch,
  and never writes gatekeeper queue records. The VM-side client
  (`backchannel/bc.py`, stdlib only) sends through the GitHub
  contents API (works during VM write waves), refuses to
  overwrite an unacknowledged pending command unless `--force`,
  and verifies every send by read-back; offline tests live in
  `backchannel/test_bc.py`. Named recovery use cases: restart
  the packaged tray in the owner's session, read `tray.log`,
  restart a runner lane, read-only network diagnostics.
- Periodic Syncyard status-check duty, fleet-wide (spec 009
  FR-005): every agent that uses Syncyard checks status before
  submitting desktop work and at least once per hour during an
  active desktop campaign (`gk status`, otherwise the
  backchannel heartbeat/status); a stale heartbeat (>5 min) or a
  down tray/runner is reported to the Desktop Access chat, never
  worked around. SKILL.md carries the duty and a Failsafe
  Backchannel section.
- Job protection on any Syncyard change (spec 009 FR-006):
  begin with a queue snapshot (record count, aggregate sha256
  of queue files, open-job list) and end with reconciliation —
  the open-job set after must equal the set before, or every
  difference is named and explained. No job may be lost
  silently.

### Fixed
- Gatekeeper record updates are atomic swaps (spec 001 FR-013):
  a job record's file is only ever replaced by renaming a fully
  verified temp file over it — the record path is never opened
  for writing. The pre-FR-013 direct-write fallback truncated
  the standing record before verification could fail, which is
  how records were lost in the 2026-10-28 write waves despite
  verified-retry. A failed save now leaves the prior record
  standing untouched (or nothing, for a new record — no husk
  can exist), sweep-internal saves go through a safe wrapper
  that ledgers `save_failed` and continues the pass, and a job
  whose pre-dispatch save fails is skipped rather than
  dispatched unrecorded. Proven by the fault-injection battery
  in gatekeeper/test_fr013.py.
- Gatekeeper FR-012 refinement (same night): the failed-write
  cleanup removes only content that is not a valid record (0-byte
  or partial husks); a failed UPDATE leaves the last valid record
  standing and fails loudly. The first cleanup compared bytes and
  deleted a live record on a failed dispatch update - found and
  fixed under the pause-first fix discipline.
- Gatekeeper durable writes (spec 001 FR-012): every queue, ledger
  and control-file write is now write-verify-retry — unbuffered
  write, read-back byte verification, bounded retries with backoff,
  loud failure when unverifiable. The loader skips unreadable
  records with a warning, and a submission reports queued only
  after the loader verifies the record written. Defect escalation
  2026-10-27: the host VM intermittently refuses writes and can
  silently drop a buffered write, leaving a 0-byte file.


### Added

- Tray offline state is unmistakable: with no runners up (or one
  faulted) the tray mark renders in grayscale under its red slash;
  the color states mean at least one runner is live (FR-007).
- Tray icon and menu (spec 007 FR-007/FR-008): the notification
  icon is the official mark loaded from a copy embedded in the
  program itself — clean when all runners are up, amber slash when
  some are down, red slash when none are up or one has faulted. The
  menu gains Start all and Stop all above the per-lane controls.
- Runner directories move under the user profile
  (`%USERPROFILE%\Development\Syncyard\runners\<lane>`) — nothing
  Syncyard-owned sits in the drive root. Tray and watchdog defaults
  and the setup docs follow; the tray installer is rebuilt against
  the new locations (spec 007 T010).
- Spec 007 T007 — a real Windows installer for the tray:
  `SyncyardTray-Setup-0.1.0.exe` (NSIS; per-user, silent `/S` mode,
  registered uninstaller), published as a GitHub Release asset with
  a SHA-256, plus `assets/logo.ico` and the tray icon now carrying
  the project mark with a state badge. README and SETUP.md document
  the download route and manual from-source installation.
- Spec 007 — windowless runner supervision: the Syncyard Tray app
  (`runner/tray/SyncyardTray.cs` + `install-tray.ps1`) supervises the
  runners from the owner's tray — hidden starts, per-lane state,
  capped restarts with an OWNER NEEDED alert, stray-console hiding,
  logon autostart. `setup-runner.ps1` now starts runners hidden too,
  and the tray subsumes the planned watchdog scheduled task.
- Gatekeeper push notifications: jobs register a chat with
  `--notify-chat` (on submit or adopt) and receive started (with
  expected length), completed (marker verdict), and W2-escalation
  pushes via the new `gk outbox` command — no polling and no new
  infrastructure (spec 001 FR-011).
- Spec 006 closed: the polish pull request merged 2026-10-27 under
  the owner's one-time protection pause, with protection verified
  identical afterward.
- New project logo: a marshalling-yard mark (three lanes converging through
  one gate) as `assets/logo.svg`, with rendered `assets/logo.png` and
  `assets/social-preview.png` alongside it. Replaces the previous emblem.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` (development setup, the self-hosted security invariant
  for contributions, review and changelog discipline) and
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant 2.1).
- README badges for CI status and the latest release.
- `gk.py status` now leads with queued/running counts and an ISSUES
  section (watermark breaches, failed or pending log harvests, stale
  dispatches, completions without a marker verdict), and takes a
  `--repo` flag that adds project-repo health: latest CI runs, open
  Dependabot alerts, and open Dependabot pull requests.
- A daily health check reviews the status board, the ledger, CI, and
  Dependabot, and reports issues to the operating chat.
- Spec-kit + AEE governance: a project constitution
  (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) and numbered specs under
  `specs/` (001 gatekeeper dispatch, 002 runner lanes, 003 status /
  logging / health, 004 WSL2 management, 005 fleet cutover,
  006 repository and governance), each with an `aee-claims.json`
  recording every requirement as a claim with evidence and a
  falsification test.
- The SKILL.md currency rule, stated in SKILL.md and CONTRIBUTING.md:
  SKILL.md is updated in the same change as any behavior change.
- Gatekeeper pause/resume: `gk pause --reason <text>` holds dispatch
  of program jobs (the watch pass continues; status shows the pause
  banner; sweep summaries print PAUSED) and `gk resume` clears it.
  Jobs submitted with `--maintenance` dispatch during a pause,
  bypassing the active cap and lane serialization but never the
  duplicate check — for operator work on the fleet itself.
- Gatekeeper stop/start and purge, completing the lifecycle CLI:
  `gk stop` is the hard halt (sweeps return before spending any API
  budget — no watch, no dispatch) and `gk start` clears both a stop
  and a pause. `gk purge` removes terminal (completed/cancelled) job
  records, dry-run unless `--yes`, with an optional
  `--older-than-days` filter and `--ledger` to archive the ledger
  to a fresh one.

### Fixed

- Log harvest now falls back to the REST logs archive when
  `gh run view --log` cannot read a run (observed in the field: some
  runs' logs are unreadable through the CLI but fine through the API).
  The harvest records which source supplied the log.
- Job-state saves fall back to a shell write when the host denies the
  native temp-file write path, so sweeps keep persisting state through
  intermittent write restrictions.

### Changed (logging)

- Sweeps now also write their one-line summary to a human-readable
  rotating log (`gatekeeper.log`, 1 MB, one backup) alongside the
  append-only JSON ledger.

### Changed

- **License: the project is now licensed under the Apache License,
  Version 2.0** (owner decision, 2026-10-27), superseding the
  all-rights-reserved terms the 0.1.x releases shipped with. The
  historical release entries below are unchanged.
- Project renamed from Sallyport to Syncyard. The repository is now
  `AXIOVEX/syncyard`; GitHub redirects the previous repository URL.
  Documentation, the agent skill, workflow and client repository
  constants, setup defaults, templates, and release metadata now use
  the Syncyard name.
- README now describes the project in terms of synchronized runner
  lanes: a marshalling yard for CPU and GPU jobs dispatched through
  GitHub Actions.
- The version stays at 0.1.1 for now, by owner decision: no version
  bump until the project is fully landed, passes full CI, and has
  served as the fleet's daily driver for a few days.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-29

### Added

- Spec 009 — failsafe backchannel (see the `[Unreleased]` entry
  above for the full description): the dedicated `syncyard-dev`
  channel in the private `tbitcs/syncyard-backchannel` repo, the
  WSL systemd agent and its installer, the `bc.py` contents-API
  client with offline tests, the fleet-wide periodic
  status-check duty (FR-005), and queue snapshot/reconciliation
  job protection on any Syncyard change (FR-006). Released by
  the owner's explicit "deploy new version" order of 2026-10-29,
  which overrides the earlier version hold.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-27

### Fixed

- Clients: the run-discovery polling loop used an unused loop variable
  (`for i in $(seq ...)`), which failed the ShellCheck CI step
  (SC2034). The loops now use the conventional throwaway variable;
  behavior is unchanged. Caught by the first CI run of the scaffold.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-27

### Added

- Project scaffold: README with the architecture, security model,
  quickstart, and lane table; the project logo
  (`assets/logo.png` — a fortress gate with a raised portcullis and a
  dispatch arrow passing through).
- `SKILL.md`, the agent operating skill: gatekeeper commands, lane
  routing rules, the marker-verdict rule, API discipline, watermark
  escalation etiquette, hardware scenario-job rules, and the
  break-glass note.
- The gatekeeper (`gatekeeper/gk.py` with its README): one
  dispatch/watch door with API-headroom stand-down, duplicate-dispatch
  refusal, lane serialization, batched watching, marker harvesting,
  and watermark recording that never cancels.
- Runner kit (`runner/`): the dispatch-only workflows `run`, `wsl`,
  and `grab`; `setup-runner.ps1` for per-lane runner registration as a
  user-window process; `runner-watchdog.ps1` to keep runner listeners
  alive; `SETUP.md`, the owner-session runbook ending in per-lane
  identity proofs.
- Convenience clients (`clients/`) for interactive one-offs, with the
  gatekeeper named as the preferred route.
- `docs/STANDARD.md` — the fleet standard: API budget discipline,
  runner lanes, and job health (watermarks and the check-before-cancel
  ladder).
- `docs/MIGRATION.md` — the cutover plan with its gates: re-register
  runners under this repository during the setup session, prove each
  lane by identity job, delete the predecessor runner repositories
  only after that proof, and archive (never delete) the predecessor
  administration repository that holds the frozen emergency path.
- `SECURITY.md` — the security model for a public repository with
  self-hosted runners (dispatch-only triggers, hosted-only CI,
  repository-scoped registration, no secrets in the repo) and the
  private reporting route.
- Continuous integration on GitHub-hosted runners: Python syntax and
  an offline gatekeeper smoke test, ShellCheck on the clients, a
  PowerShell parse check on the runner scripts, a changelog/version
  check, and a guard that fails any workflow combining self-hosted
  runners with unprivileged triggers.
- Repository policies: pull request and issue templates, Dependabot
  for GitHub Actions, CODEOWNERS, and branch protection requiring a
  pull request, an approving review, and green CI.
