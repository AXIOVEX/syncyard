# Gatekeeper

The gatekeeper is the single dispatch/watch door for the Syncyard
self-hosted runner fleet. Programs submit job requests to it; it alone
dispatches and watches, under the fleet standard in
[docs/STANDARD.md](../docs/STANDARD.md) (Parts 2 and 4). It is files plus
a CLI — no daemon. A cron-driven `gk sweep` every 5 minutes does all API
work in one batched pass.

This repository is the canonical published source of the gatekeeper. An
operator's live copy is a checkout of a release of this repository (plus
its local `queue/` and `ledger.jsonl` state); fixes land here first,
with a version bump and a changelog entry.

## Layout

```text
gatekeeper/
  gk.py               the CLI (Python 3, standard library only)
  queue/<job-id>.json one JSON per job (state of record per job)
  ledger.jsonl        append-only event log (submitted / adopted /
                      dispatched / state_change / watermark_breach /
                      watermark_escalation / log_harvested / ...)
  sweep.log           cron target for sweep output
```

`queue/`, `ledger.jsonl`, and `sweep.log` are operator state and are
git-ignored; they exist only in a live copy.

## Configuration

Two constants at the top of `gk.py` are the fleet's configuration
points:

- `REPO` — the GitHub repository the runners are registered to
  (`AXIOVEX/syncyard`).
- `DEFAULT_CWD` — the default working directory per workflow on the
  operator's machines. Set these to your own account's paths when
  deploying your own fleet.

Other tunables (stand-down thresholds, the pre-lane active-run cap,
watermark tables) live beside them, in one place, with comments.

```

- **submit** writes a job file in state `submitted` and records the
  script's SHA-256. If an *active* job (submitted / dispatching /
  dispatched / watching) already carries the same `--key`, submit
  refuses and prints the existing job id (exit 3). This is the local
  half of the duplicate-dispatch pre-check.
- **adopt** registers an already-dispatched run for watching (no
  dispatch). It refuses if the key or the run id is already tracked by
  an active job.
- **sweep** (one pass; run it from cron every 5 minutes):
  1. Checks `gh api rate_limit` first (the endpoint is free). Core
     remaining **below 1,000**: dispatch nothing, record a
     `budget_standdown` event, and still do the watch pass with the one
     list call. **Below 500**: record `budget_critical` and exit — no
     list call at all.
  2. Dispatch pass over `submitted` jobs in submission order. Gates:
     same-lane serialization (one live gatekeeper job per lane), an
     identical in-flight dispatch check (same workflow + same script
     SHA-256 already holding → `dispatch_skipped_duplicate`), and a
     total cap of **2 gatekeeper-active runs** (`MAX_ACTIVE_DISPATCHED`)
     until real lanes stand up. Each job's state is written as
     `dispatching` *before* the `gh` call; a `dispatching` state older
     than 10 minutes with no run id is flagged `stale_dispatching` for a
     human and is never auto-redispatched. The created run id is
     captured from the URL `gh workflow run` prints, falling back to a
     list call filtered by workflow + creation time, skipping ids
     already recorded — an id that does not resolve is never latched.
  3. Watch pass: ONE `gh run list` call covers every tracked run. State
     changes are ledgered; a newly completed run's log is fetched
     exactly once, its marker lines (job-printed lines starting with an
     `ALL_CAPS_` marker token) and the last 200 log lines are stored in
     the job file, with `verdict_source="markers"`. Verdicts come from
     markers, never from the Actions conclusion alone.
  4. Watermarks (standard Part 4, pre-lane transition rule). Queued
     W1/W2 per lane: quick 10/30, normal 20/45, long 45/120, gpu 30/90
     minutes. Queued W1 is *recorded* only; queued W2 also sets a job
     flag and a `watermark_escalation` event. Executing W1/W2: quick
     5/15, normal 45/90; long/gpu use the declared expectation (W1 =
     1.5×, W2 = 2×) floored at long 90/180 and gpu 120/240 minutes. On
     an executing W1/W2 breach the sweep spends ONE extra jobs call to
     record the current step, so a W2 escalation can report step
     progression (advanced vs. frozen). **A breach never cancels
     anything.** The sweep only records and escalates; cancellation
     authority stays with the dispatching program's coordinator or the
     owner, per Part 4.
  5. Prints exactly one summary line, for example
     `SWEEP 2026-10-27T15:21:57Z budget_remaining=4297 dispatched=0 changes=6 breaches=12 active=6 waiting=1`
- **status** prints the board: counts by state, queued/running counts,
  all live jobs with lane / run status / flags, completed jobs with
  marker counts, an ISSUES section (watermark breaches, failed or
  pending log harvests, completions without a marker verdict), and the
  last 10 ledger events. `status --repo` adds project-repo health:
  latest CI runs, open Dependabot alerts, and open Dependabot pull
  requests (three API calls; the default status is local-only).
- **Logging** is two-layered: the append-only JSON ledger
  (`ledger.jsonl`, one record per event — the machine record) and a
  human-readable rotating log (`gatekeeper.log`, one line per sweep,
  1 MB with one backup). Log harvest tries `gh run view --log` first
  and falls back to the REST logs archive, recording which source
  supplied the log.
- **cancel** retires a job that has not been dispatched yet (local
  state only). It refuses for dispatched jobs and never cancels a
  GitHub run.
- **Lifecycle control** — `pause` holds dispatch of program jobs (the
  watch pass keeps running; jobs submitted with `--maintenance` still
  dispatch, bypassing the pause, the active cap, and lane
  serialization but never the duplicate check); `resume` clears a
  pause. `stop` is the hard halt: a sweep returns immediately — no
  budget spent, no watch, no dispatch — until `start` clears both
  stop and pause. `status` shows the control state in a banner.
  `purge` removes terminal (completed/cancelled) job records, dry-run
  unless `--yes`; `--older-than-days N` restricts it to records
  created more than N days ago, and `--ledger` also archives
  `ledger.jsonl` to a timestamped file and starts a fresh one. Job
  records carry the harvested markers and log tails — they are the
  evidence trail — so purge with an age filter is the norm, not the
  exception.

One platform caveat, observed in the field: GitHub's run-level status
for a run can lag or sit at `queued` while the job's log already holds
the complete result. That is why the gatekeeper stores the log and the
markers at completion and treats markers as the verdict source — if the
API state and the log disagree, believe the log.

## Workflow inputs

| Workflow | Inputs | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `run.yml` | `cmd_b64` (required), `cwd` | PowerShell, base64 of the script |
| `wsl.yml` | `cmd_b64` (required), `cwd` | bash in WSL2, base64 of the script |
| `grab.yml` | **`path` only** | Uploads one file from the machine as artifact `grabbed-file`. **No `cmd_b64`, no `cwd`, no script.** |

The grab difference matters: a grab job is submitted with
`--grab-path "<file path on the machine>"` instead of `--script`. File
returns remain a deliberate step: the gatekeeper watches grab runs and
harvests their markers, but does not chain grabs automatically.

## Cron

```cron
*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/env python3 /path/to/gatekeeper/gk.py sweep >> /path/to/gatekeeper/sweep.log 2>&1
```

Every 5 minutes matches the fleet poll floor; the sweep self-locks, so
an overlapping invocation is a no-op.

## The runner watchdog is separate

The desktop-side runner watchdog (`runner/runner-watchdog.ps1`) keeps
runner listeners alive on the machines. It is installed during the
setup session described in [runner/SETUP.md](../runner/SETUP.md) — it
is not installed by anything in this folder.

## What the gatekeeper does not do

- **No webhook push (yet).** Watching is the 5-minute batched sweep. A
  later phase can add push notifications to cut polling further.
- **No cancellation, ever.** Watermark breaches are recorded and
  flagged; the check-before-cancel ladder's human steps and any
  cancellation stay with the dispatching program / the owner.
- **No automatic grab chaining.** File returns are dispatched as their
  own jobs.
- **No probe jobs.** The standard's machine-state probes are a
  coordination decision, not something the sweep fires on its own.
