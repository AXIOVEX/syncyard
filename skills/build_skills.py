"""Generate every Syncyard agent-skill edition from one shared source.

Spec 010 FR-006 (Amendment 1 ranking): editions are generated from
`skills/_source/contract.md` so their content cannot drift. Each
edition is the shared contract plus a small host-specific front
matter and install note. Run with no arguments to (re)write the
editions; run with --check to verify the committed editions match
a fresh render byte for byte (CI does this via test_skills.py).

Usage: python3 skills/build_skills.py [--check]
